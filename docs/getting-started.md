## Data Storage

Chefsire1 stores your recipes in `~/.chefsire1/`:

You can backup this directory to preserve your recipes, or use version control to track changes.

## Tips for Success

1. **Use descriptive names** - Make recipe names searchable and memorable
2. **Tag consistently** - Use consistent tags like "dinner", "vegetarian", "quick" for easy filtering
3. **Include equipment** - List required tools to help with meal planning
4. **Add notes** - Include tips, variations, or substitutions in the notes field
5. **Use proper units** - Be specific with measurements for consistent results

## Example Workflow

Here's a typical workflow for meal planning:

```bash
# Find quick dinner recipes
chefsire list --tags dinner --max-time 30

# Get details for a specific recipe
chefsire show "Spaghetti Carbonara"

# Generate shopping list
chefsire shopping "Spaghetti Carbonara"

# Find recipes using ingredients you have
