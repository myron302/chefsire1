- [ ] Set up state management (Redux Toolkit or Zustand)
- [ ] Install and configure shared package dependency

### Phase 2: Core Components
- [ ] Create reusable UI components matching web design
- [ ] Implement responsive layouts for different screen sizes
- [ ] Set up theming system consistent with web app
- [ ] Create shared component library

### Phase 3: API Integration
- [ ] Set up API client using the same endpoints as web
- [ ] Implement authentication flow
- [ ] Add offline support with local storage
- [ ] Implement push notifications

### Phase 4: Core Features
- [ ] Home screen with featured recipes and stories
- [ ] Recipe browsing and search functionality
- [ ] Recipe detail view with cooking mode
- [ ] User profile and authentication
- [ ] Recipe creation and editing
- [ ] Story creation and sharing

### Phase 5: Mobile-Specific Features
- [ ] Camera integration for recipe photos
- [ ] Barcode scanning for ingredients
- [ ] Shopping list functionality
- [ ] Cooking timer and voice commands
- [ ] Social sharing capabilities

### Phase 6: Performance & Polish
- [ ] Optimize images and assets
- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Performance monitoring and analytics
- [ ] App store deployment preparation

## Technical Considerations

### Shared Code Strategy
- Leverage `@chefsire/shared` package for:
  - Type definitions and schemas
  - Utility functions
  - API response types
  - Business logic

### Mobile-First Approach
- Use responsive design principles from web app
- Implement touch-friendly interactions
- Consider mobile UX patterns and conventions
- Optimize for various screen sizes and orientations

### Development Tools
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo (recommended for rapid development)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Navigation**: React Navigation v6
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit or Zustand
- **API Client**: React Query + Axios
- **UI Components**: Custom components + React Native Elements
- **Testing**: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- **Build**: EAS Build (Expo) or standard React Native build

### API Compatibility
The mobile app will use the same REST API endpoints as the web application:
- `GET /api/recipes` - List recipes
- `GET /api/recipes/:id` - Get recipe details
- `POST /api/recipes` - Create new recipe
- `GET /api/stories` - List stories
- `GET /api/users/:id` - Get user profile

## Getting Started (Future)

When ready to implement the mobile app:

1. Install React Native development environment
2. Initialize new React Native project in this directory
3. Install shared dependencies
4. Set up development server connection to API
5. Begin with Phase 1 tasks above

## Design Consistency

The mobile app should maintain visual and functional consistency with the web application:
- Use the same color scheme and typography
- Implement similar navigation patterns adapted for mobile
- Ensure feature parity where appropriate
- Follow mobile-specific UX guidelines while maintaining brand identity
